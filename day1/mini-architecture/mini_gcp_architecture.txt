Mini GCP Architecture: File Upload & Processing System
======================================================

Overview:
---------
This architecture describes a simple web application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
that allows users to upload files, processes those files, and stores metadata in a
database. The system uses various GCP services working together in a serverless and
event-driven manner.

Components and Roles:
---------------------

1. Cloud Storage (GCS):
   - Stores uploaded files (e.g., images, CSVs, PDFs).

2. Cloud Functions:
   - Automatically triggered on file upload to process or scan the file.

3. Pub/Sub:
   - Transports messages (e.g., file metadata) between services asynchronously.

4. Cloud Run / App Engine:
   - Hosts backend services or APIs to interact with users or other services.

5. Firestore / BigQuery / Cloud SQL:
   - Stores processed metadata, file details, or analytics data.

6. Cloud Logging / Cloud Monitoring:
   - Provides observability, diagnostics, and metrics for the services.

Interaction Flow:
-----------------

1. User Uploads a File:
   - User uploads a file via a frontend application.
   - The backend (hosted on Cloud Run or App Engine) receives the file and stores it in GCS.

2. Cloud Storage Triggers Cloud Function:
   - When a new file is added, GCS sends an event that triggers a Cloud Function.

3. Cloud Function Publishes to Pub/Sub:
   - The Cloud Function extracts metadata from the file and publishes a message to a Pub/Sub topic.

4. Cloud Run / Another Cloud Function Subscribes to Pub/Sub:
   - Another service (Cloud Run or Cloud Function) listens to the Pub/Sub topic.
   - It processes the message and stores the metadata in Firestore or another database.

5. Monitoring and Logging:
   - All services log events to Cloud Logging.
   - Cloud Monitoring tracks metrics like invocation count, latency, and error rates.
