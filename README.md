## Why Choose GCP Over Other Cloud Providers?

### Cost Advantages for Startups

**Sustained Use Discounts**: GCP automatically applies discounts when compute instances run for more than 25% of a billing month, providing up to 30% savings without requiring upfront commitments or reserved instances.

**Per-Second Billing**: Unlike providers that bill in hourly increments, GCP bills compute resources per second after the first minute, making it cost-effective for variable workloads and development environments.

**Startup Credits**: Google for Startups program offers up to $100,000 in cloud credits for qualifying startups, along with technical support and mentorship opportunities.

**Preemptible Instances**: Cost-effective compute options that can reduce expenses by up to 80% for fault-tolerant workloads like batch processing, CI/CD pipelines, and development environments.

### Technical Advantages

**Global Network Infrastructure**: GCP operates one of the world's largest private networks, providing faster data transfer and lower latency between regions compared to competitors.

**Kubernetes-Native Platform**: As the birthplace of Kubernetes, GCP offers the most mature and integrated container orchestration platform with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

**BigQuery Integration**: Seamless access to Google's serverless data warehouse, enabling startups to perform analytics on large datasets without managing infrastructure.

**Machine Learning Services**: Access to the same AI/ML infrastructure that powers Google's products, including pre-trained models and AutoML capabilities.

### Storage Advantages

**Multi-Regional Storage**: Built-in geo-redundancy for critical data with 99.95% availability SLA and automatic failover capabilities.

**Intelligent Tiering**: Automatic lifecycle management that moves data between storage classes based on access patterns, optimizing costs without manual intervention.

**Transfer Appliance**: Physical data transfer service for large migrations, reducing time and bandwidth costs for moving petabytes of data to the cloud.

## VPC vs Default Networking: Why Custom Networks Matter

### Default Network Limitations

The default network configuration in GCP creates a single network with automatically generated subnets in each region. While convenient for getting started, it has several limitations for production workloads:

- **Security Risks**: All instances can communicate with each other by default, violating the principle of least privilege
- **Limited Control**: Cannot customize IP ranges or implement network segmentation
- **No Isolation**: Different applications and environments share the same network space
- **Compliance Issues**: Many regulatory frameworks require network isolation and controlled access

### VPC Advantages

**Network Segmentation**: Create isolated network environments for different applications, teams, or environments (development, staging, production).

**Custom IP Addressing**: Define your own IP ranges and subnets, enabling integration with on-premises networks and avoiding IP conflicts.

**Granular Firewall Rules**: Implement precise security controls using tags, service accounts, and IP ranges to control traffic flow between resources.

**Multiple Subnets per Region**: Create separate subnets for different tiers of your application (web, application, database) within the same region.

**Private Google Access**: Enable instances without external IP addresses to access Google Cloud services, reducing attack surface while maintaining functionality.

**Shared VPC**: Allow multiple projects to share a common network while maintaining project-level isolation for billing and access control.


## GCP Regions and Zones: Impact on Performance and Availability

### Understanding the Hierarchy

**Regions**: Independent geographic areas containing multiple zones, typically within a few hundred kilometers of each other. Each region operates independently with its own power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.

**Zones**: Isolated locations within regions, representing separate data centers with independent infrastructure. Zones within a region are connected by low-latency, high-bandwidth networks.

### Performance Considerations

**Latency Optimization**: 
- **Intra-zone**: Sub-millisecond latency between resources in the same zone
- **Inter-zone**: Low single-digit millisecond latency within the same region
- **Inter-region**: Varies by geographic distance, typically 50-200ms globally

**Network Throughput**: 
- Maximum bandwidth between zones in the same region (up to 32 Gbps per VM)
- Regional persistent disks can be accessed from any zone within the region
- Cross-region replication for databases and storage with predictable performance

**Data Locality**: Place compute resources close to your users and data sources to minimize latency and improve user experience.

### Availability and Resilience Strategies

**Single Zone Deployment**:
- Lowest cost and complexity
- Single point of failure
- Suitable for development and non-critical workloads

**Multi-Zone Deployment**:
- Protects against zone-level failures
- Automatic failover capabilities
- Regional persistent disks provide cross-zone data access
- Recommended for production workloads

**Multi-Region Deployment**:
- Maximum availability and disaster recovery
- Protects against region-wide outages
- Enables global load balancing and CDN integration
- Higher complexity and cost

### Global Application Architecture

**Traffic Distribution**:
- Global Load Balancer routes users to the nearest healthy region
- Cloud CDN caches static content at edge locations worldwide
- Anycast IP addresses provide single global entry point

**Data Replication**:
- Firestore and Spanner offer automatic multi-region replication
- Cloud SQL supports cross-region read replicas
- Cloud Storage provides multi-regional and dual-regional options

**Disaster Recovery**:
- Implement automated backup and restore procedures across regions
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Deployment Manager) for consistent deployments
- Regular disaster recovery testing and failover procedures

### Region Selection Criteria

1. **User Location**: Choose regions closest to your primary user base
2. **Data Residency**: Comply with local data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)
3. **Service Availability**: Ensure required GCP services are available in chosen regions
4. **Cost Considerations**: Pricing varies by region based on local infrastructure costs
5. **Compliance Requirements**: Some industries require data to remain within specific geographic boundaries

## GCP IAM Best Practices & Concepts

### Why is it dangerous to assign the **Editor** role to all users in a production environment?
The **Editor** role grants broad permissions including the ability to modify or delete almost any resource in a project. Assigning it to all users:
- Violates the **principle of least privilege**
- Increases the risk of **accidental misconfigurations** or **security breaches**
- Makes it harder to **audit actions**, since many users have overlapping permissions

### How do **service accounts** differ from **user accounts** in managing backend services?
| Feature             | Service Account                         | User Account                               |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Used By             | Applications, VMs, services              | Human users                                 |
| Authentication      | Key-based (JSON key or Workload Identity)| Username & password (OAuth2, SSO, etc.)     |
| Lifecycle           | Managed by project owners                | Managed by the individual or identity provider |
| Example Use Case    | A VM accessing Cloud Storage             | A developer using `gcloud` CLI               |

Service accounts are designed for **automated access** to GCP resources by applications or VMs.

### What practices help secure IAM in a multi-project GCP setup?
1. **Use least privilege**: Assign only the minimum necessary permissions.
2. **Use custom roles**: Tailor permissions to match exact use cases.
3. **Use folders and organizations**: Group projects and apply IAM policies hierarchically.
4. **Separate environments**: Isolate dev, staging, and prod into separate projects.
5. **Audit and monitor IAM**: Regularly review permissions and enable Cloud Audit Logs.
6. **Avoid using primitive roles** (`Owner`, `Editor`, `Viewer`) in production.


In production, it's best to use **remote backends** like Google Cloud Storage (GCS), which support locking and team collaboration.

### What is the difference between Declarative IaC and Imperative Scripting?

    Declarative Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (e.g., Terraform):

        You define what the desired end state of your infrastructure should be.

        Terraform figures out how to reach that state.

        Example: “There should be a VM with 4 vCPUs in us-central1.”

    Imperative Scripting (e.g., Bash, Python with gcloud commands):

        You explicitly define how to reach your goal step by step.

        You are responsible for the execution order and logic.

        Example: gcloud compute instances create ... followed by gcloud storage buckets create ...

####Key difference:
Declarative focuses on outcomes, Imperative focuses on procedures. Why is Terraform state important, and how can it become a security risk?

    Terraform state (terraform.tfstate) tracks the actual state of resources in your cloud environment.

    It allows Terraform to determine what changes to apply by comparing the current state with your desired config.

Importance:

    Enables terraform plan to show accurate diffs.

    Ensures consistent, idempotent updates.

    Needed for features like terraform destroy.

Security Risks:

    The state file can contain sensitive data such as:

        Secret keys

        Passwords

        Resource metadata

    If stored or shared insecurely (e.g., in a public repo), it can expose your infrastructure to attackers.

Best Practices:

    Use terraform state encrypt (with backends like S3 + KMS).

    Store state securely (e.g., GCS buckets with IAM policies).

    Use state locking to avoid concurrent corruption.
 
### When should a team use Terraform over manual provisioning?

Use Terraform when:

    You want reproducibility across environments (dev, staging, prod).

    You work in a team and need version-controlled infrastructure.

    You need automation as part of CI/CD pipelines.

    You want to audit changes (via terraform plan, apply, and VCS).

    You’re provisioning multiple resources across services (VMs, buckets, networking, etc.).

    You value rollback and predictability.

Manual provisioning is fine for quick, one-off setups — but doesn’t scale for teams or production-grade systems.
