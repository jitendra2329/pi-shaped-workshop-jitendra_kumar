Difference between Primitive, Predefined, and Custom Roles in Google Cloud

1. Primitive Roles:
   - These are the basic roles provided by GCP at the project level.
   - Examples: Owner, Editor, Viewer
   - Broad permissions; not recommended for production due to over-privilege risk.

2. Predefined Roles:
   - GCP-created roles tailored to specific services.
   - Examples: roles/storage.objectViewer, roles/compute.instanceAdmin
   - More granular than primitive roles, follow least privilege principle.

3. Custom Roles:
   - User-defined roles where you choose specific permissions.
   - Use when predefined roles are too broad or don't fit exactly.
   - Offers maximum control; requires careful planning.

Summary:
- Use Predefined roles when possible.
- Use Custom roles for precise control.
- Avoid Primitive roles unless absolutely necessary.
